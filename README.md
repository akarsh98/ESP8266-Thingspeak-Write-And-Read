In this project we are going to understand the Thingspeak platform along with the idea of MQTT and then using Thingspeak with an ESP8266.

We will connect DHT11 Temperature Sensor with ESP8266 module and code the module to continuously send the temperature sensed by DHT11 to Thingspeak Platform. 

Towards the end we will be able to check the temperature data stored on Thingspeak over a course of time and will also be able to see the trend followed by the temperature with the help of visualization provided in Thingspeak.
